We were looking for different deeplearning frameworks apart from tensorflow and found out that  Pytorch has better advantages over tensorflow:


1. PyTorch is a Dynamic Computational Graph (DCG) which provides much more flexiblity in coding  and the framework is more tightly integrated with Python

2. Pytorch gives a better development experince as its supports most of the existing packages- NumPy, SciPy, Cython. The code is easier to read and intuitive which gives us much more access to code flow and tracebacks are easy to follow

3. Networks are modular ie. each part can be implemented separately and can also be debugged individualy,

4. Since computation graph in PyTorch is defined at runtime we can use any Python debugging tools such as spyder, PyCharm with simple print statements.
5. Pytorch also provide a multi gpu training support.

6 .Switching between python and pytorch environment (tensor to numpy array ) is really easy as compared to tensorflow.


And  for object detection please let us know the list of objects to be focussed based on that we can select the best suited datasets.
